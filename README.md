# Zomato-Data-Analysis-and-Vis.
In this project -> Zomato food delivery data analysis project, I applied Python extensively to analyze and visualize large datasets to derive meaningful insights. Python's flexibility and powerful libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn played a crucial role in cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the data.
<br>
# Insights we get
<br>
1)
What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?<br>
2 How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?<br>
3) What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?<br>
4)Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their
average spending on each order?<br>
5) Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?<br>
6) Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those
customers with some good offers?
